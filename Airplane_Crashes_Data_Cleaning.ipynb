    " Column Type\tBest Method to Handle Missing Data\tWhy This Method Works Well\n",
    "Numerical columns (e.g., Aboard, Fatalities)\tFill with the Mean or Median\tIf the numbers are evenly spread (normally distributed), using the mean makes sense. If the data has extreme values or is skewed, use the median, since it’s not affected by outliers. This keeps the number of records the same and maintains the column’s general shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical columns (e.g., Location, Operator)\tFill with the Mode (most frequent value)\tFor text-based or categorical data, it’s usually safe to assume that missing values belong to the most common category. This approach is simple, preserves all rows, and works well for nominal data (where order doesn’t matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical or Text columns with few missing values\tReplace with a constant (like “Unknown” or “Missing”)\tSometimes it’s best to mark missing entries explicitly. Using labels like “Unknown” lets you keep all data and signals that information was missing — instead of guessing what it might have been.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any column with very high missingness (over 70%)\tDrop the column entirely\tWhen most values are missing, the column doesn’t provide meaningful insight. Trying to fill in so many gaps could distort the data and make the analysis unreliable. Removing it avoids introducing bias.\n"
